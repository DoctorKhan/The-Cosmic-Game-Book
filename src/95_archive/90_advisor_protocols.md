## Quick Tests (Social Diagnostic in Practice)

Use these as observable “outside‑in” checks:

1) Consistency Under Pressure

- Evidence: Fair, calm, compassionate conduct during stress; no pattern of convenient exceptions

2) Positive Fruits

- Evidence: Track record of actions that lead to reconciliation, healing, and flourishing for family and community

3) Humility Over Charisma

- Evidence: Service without status‑seeking; decisions explained, not imposed; openness to correction

4) Community Vetting Over Time

- Evidence: Reputation built across seasons by diverse stakeholders (not just a loyal in‑group)

Warning: Charisma is not a credential—treat it as a red flag to test, not a reason to follow.

## Four Spheres Conflict Map (Where to Resolve What)

- Self: Regulate, tell the truth, repair; do not outsource conscience to applause or outrage
- Tribe: Resolve interpersonal harms, restore trust, and share loads before conflicts metastasize
- Alliance: Mediate cross‑tribal disputes; metabolize charge between groups before it escalates to ideology
- System: Codify minimal, equal rules; avoid totalizing claims over interior life; last resort for enforcement

Protocol: Always attempt resolution at the lowest competent sphere; escalate only if capacity is exceeded.

## Advisor Operating Principles

- Earned, Not Claimed Authority: Let fruits and time speak; avoid titles that imply divine mandate
- Bridge, Not Judge: Offer second opinions and help parties navigate Soul vs State, don’t replace courts or consciences
- Transparent Reasoning: Make your logic and tradeoffs legible; publish decision hygiene, not decrees
- Anti‑Capture Discipline: Rotate roles, disclose conflicts, refuse perks that bind loyalties

## Outside‑In On‑Ramp (No Meditation Required)

If deep interior practice isn’t your starting point, commit to:

- Daily service that measurably reduces harm or increases belonging
- A weekly reconciliation ritual (repair one relationship or one decision)
- A monthly fruits review with peers (what healed? what harmed?)

These practices build the substrate for authentic inner peace.
