Key references and inspirations consolidated for convenience.

- Non‑dual literature echoed throughout (Spira’s lineages and poetry quotes: Rumi, Blake, Shakespeare, Shelley, Kathleen Raine, Yeats)
- Comparative religion and philosophy touchstones referenced in-text
- Selected contemporary scholarship on consciousness, near‑death experiences, and contemplative science

Note: Chapters use bracketed callouts [see: References and Sources] instead of inline citations.
